# ElectricAircraftPerformanceMetrics

This is a repository containing (most of I think) the code for the paper ["Performance metrics required of next-generation batteries to electrify commercial aircraft"](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsenergylett.9b02574). The code is written in Julia; the version shouldn't be too important (it was written in 1.3, but should probably work with any post 1.0 release). Please check out the main_* scripts to reproduce the figures in the paper. Note that in the paper we took __*a lot*__ of samples for the histograms, so it could take a while.

It is not actively maintained, but feel free to open an issue here or email me if you would like to run the code and are having trouble doing so.

Cheers!

Alec
