# ElectricAircraftPerformanceMetrics

This is a repository containing (most of I think) the code for the paper ["Performance metrics required of next-generation batteries to electrify commercial aircraft"](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsenergylett.9b02574)

It is not actively maintained, but feel free to open an issue here or email me if you would like to run the code and are having trouble doing so.

Cheers!
Alec
